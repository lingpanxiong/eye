The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

中文翻译:

优美胜于丑陋。
明确胜于隐晦。
简单胜于复杂。
复杂胜于凌乱。
扁平胜于嵌套。
稀疏胜于密集。
可读性很重要。
特殊情况不足以打破规则。
除非明确沉默。
面对歧义, 拒绝猜测的诱惑。
应该有一种-- 最好只有一种 -- 显而易见的方法来解决问题。
虽然这种方法一开始并不明显, 除非你是荷兰人。
现在比永远不更好。
虽然永远比现在更好。
如果实现很难解释, 那它是个坏主意。
如果实现很容易解释, 那它可能是个好主意。
命名空间是一个很棒的主意 -- 让我们做更多这样的事情!
